### About the Project

This Java-based ATM System is a simple console application that emulates various functionalities of an ATM. It provides a secure way for users to interact with their account by requiring PIN authentication and allows multiple transactions to be conducted seamlessly in a single session.

### Features

The ATM System includes the following main functionalities:
- **PIN Authentication**: Ensures secure access to the ATM system.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current balance.
- **Cash Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw funds, with balance validation.
- **Cash Deposit**: Enables users to deposit money into their account.
- **Fund Transfer**: Allows transferring money to another account.
- **Bill Payment**: Facilitates paying utility bills.
- **Mobile Recharge**: Enables recharging a mobile number.
- **Mini Statement**: Displays the latest transactions.
- **Cheque Deposit**: Allows depositing cheques to the account.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ATMSystem.git
Navigate to Project Directory

bash
cd ATMSystem
Compile the Project Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can compile the project by running:

bash
javac -d bin src/com/pankaj/ATM/*.java
Run the Application To start the application, use the following command:

bash
java -cp bin com.pankaj.ATM.Main
Usage
Upon starting the application, you will be prompted to enter a PIN. The default **PIN** is 1234. After successful authentication, the main menu will be displayed, showing the following options:

**Cash Withdrawal**: Follow prompts to withdraw an amount from your balance.
**Cash Deposit**: Follow prompts to deposit an amount.
**Balance Inquiry**: Displays the current account balance.
**Fund Transfer**: Enter the recipient's account number and amount to transfer.
**Bill Payment**: Enter the amount to pay a bill from your balance.
**Mobile Recharge**: Enter your mobile number, select operator, and recharge amount.
**Mini Statement**: Displays recent transactions.
**Cheque Deposit**: Allows depositing a specified cheque amount.
**Exit**: Ends the session.
**Note**: Ensure that you have a positive balance to complete any withdrawal, transfer, recharge, or bill payment transactions.

**Class Structure**
The project uses several classes for modularity:

Main Class (Main.java):

Entry point for the ATM application.
Handles PIN authentication and interacts with TransactionService for various actions.
Loops through the main menu until the user decides to exit.
Account Class (Account.java):

Manages the user's balance and records transaction history.
Includes methods for withdrawing, depositing, and retrieving the balance.
Contains a printMiniStatement method that displays recent transactions.
TransactionService Class (TransactionService.java):

Handles all transaction-related functionalities, including withdrawal, deposit, fund transfer, bill payment, mobile recharge, and more.
Uses an Account instance to perform balance updates and transaction history.
Accepts a Scanner instance for interactive input within each transaction method.
UserInterface Class (UserInterface.java):

Displays menu options for users.
Separates user-facing prompts, enhancing readability and modularity.
SecurityService Class (SecurityService.java):

Provides basic PIN-based authentication to simulate security.
Currently uses a static PIN (1234), but this could be expanded for more complex security checks.
Code Example
Here's a basic example of how a **user interaction might look**:

Welcome to the ATM!
Enter your PIN: ****

Main Menu:
1. Cash Withdrawal
2. Cash Deposit
3. Balance Inquiry
4. Fund Transfer
5. Bill Payment
6. Mobile Recharge
7. Mini Statement
8. Cheque Deposit
9. Exit
